2.0 HRE Implementer Obligations
===============================

2.1. **Intellectual Property Requirements:**

-   HRE is a fully open source project, and (unless specifically agreed in
    writing by HRE Ltd) all program code must be released under the **GNU Affero
    General Public Licence or any later version** (the GNU Affero GPL). All HRE
    documentation must be released under **Creative Commons
    Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence** (CC BY-SA 4.0).

-   Background material on our choice of open licences may be found on the wiki:
    <http://hrewiki.org/index.php?title=Why_have_we_chosen_these_licences>

    Contributing developers to HRE must release their code by default under the
    GNU Affero GPL, and contributors to the wiki, the website and project
    documentation must release their contributions under CC BY-SA 4.0.

    All intending developers and documentation contributors must agree to abide
    by our Contributors Agreement, details of which can be found here:
    <http://hrewiki.org/index.php?title=Contributor_agreement>

2.2. **Committing to a Task:**

-   While we appreciate that contributors will have other demands on their time,
    and that it will not always be easy to work to hard deadlines, we do expect
    all contributors to approach the tasks they have committed to do
    professionally and in good faith. If you find that due to changed
    circumstances you are going to find it difficult to meet a deadline you
    should let us know immediately, and not wait until the last minute or - even
    worse - allow the deadline to pass without comment. Contributors who are
    repeatedly unable to meet agreed deadlines may be asked to take on some less
    challenging role or to leave the project.

2.3. **Use of Software Tools:**

-  ECLIPSE: HRE will be developed as an RCP under the Eclipse IDE. 
-  H2: the H2 database has been selected for use with HRE but this is not intended
   to preclude use of Oracle or DB2 for very large implementations.


2.4. **Coding Standards:**

-  Java: 
   All contributions should adhere to the Java Style Guide at
    <https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html> or as implemented
    in the Eclipse tool.


2.5. **Documentation Standards:**

-  Source Documentation: architecture and design documents are saved in the 
   'docs' folder of the Master branch.


2.6. **Submitting a Contribution:**

-   See
