<H1>LOCATION VIEWPOINT</H1>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td>
<p>The Location Viewpoint allows the user to see all the information recorded in HRE for the selected location. Up to 5 Location Viewpoints may be opened for each open HRE project<br>
The screen initially opens in a collapsed format showing only the location's name and 6 sub-screen title bars.</p>

<p>The 6 sub-screens defined by the title bars lie to the left and right of a vertical divider bar. The divider may be moved left or right to change the amount of screen space allocated to each half of the screen. At the top of the divider are two small arrow buttons which may be used to make either side take over the whole screen.</p>

<p>Each of the sub-screens can be displayed by clicking on the red triangle at the left of each title bar, which changes the triangle to a green downward-pointing format and opens the sub-screen. Clicking on a green triangle collapses the sub-screen. Each title bar also indicates the number of entries contained in the sub-screen, such as "Events (6)".</p>

<p>When a sub-screen is displayed it may also show "+" and "-" buttons at the top right. These enable expansion or contraction of the number of rows of data displayed in the sub-screen.</p>

<p>Should the height of the Viewpoint screen become larger than the enclosing HRE screen, the Viewpoint screen will change to a scrollable format.</p>

<p><b>Events sub-screen:</b><br>
Each entry shows information about an event occurring at this location. A checkbox enables restricting the list to show only events for which there was a Key Associate.</p>

<p><b>Superior/Inferior sub-screen:</b><br>
This is not yet implemented in HRE.</p>

<p><b>Associates sub-screen:</b><br>
This displays a list of all people associated with the selected location through their involvement in events at this location.</p>

<p><b>Images sub-screen:</b><br>
Displays all images (if any) of the location.</p>

<p><b>Flags sub-screen:</b><br>
Displays all Active flags for the location and their current settings.
</p>
<p><p><b>Notepads sub-screen:</b><br>
Notepads are not yet implemented in HRE.</p></p>
