<H1>PERSON VIEWPOINT</H1>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td>
<p>The Person Viewpoint allows the user to see all the information recorded in HRE for the selected person. Up to 5 Person Viewpoints may be opened for each open HRE project<br>
The screen initially opens in a collapsed format showing only the person's name, sex, reference information, primary image and parent's names.</p>

<p>There are 7 further sub-screens defined by title bars, 4 on the left and 3 on the right of a vertical divider bar. The divider which may be moved left or right to change the amount of screen space allocated to each half of the screen. At the top of the divider are two small arrow buttons which may be used to make either side take over the whole screen.</p>

<p>Each of the sub-screens can be displayed by clicking on the <b><font color="#ff0000">red</font></b> triangle at the left of each title bar, which changes the triangle to a <b><font color="#008000">green</font></b> downward-pointing format and opens the sub-screen. Clicking on a <b><font color="#008000">green</font></b> triangle collapses the sub-screen. Each title bar also indicates the number of entries contained in the sub-screen, such as "Events (6)".<br>
<br>When a sub-screen is displayed it may also show "<b>+</b>" and "<b>-</b>" buttons at the top right. These enable expansion or contraction of the number of rows of data displayed in the sub-screen.</p>

<p>Should the height of the Viewpoint screen become larger than the enclosing HRE screen, the Viewpoint screen will change to a scrollable format.</p>

Each entry shows information about an event in the person's life. A checkbox enables restricting the list to show only events for which the person was a Key Associate.</p>
