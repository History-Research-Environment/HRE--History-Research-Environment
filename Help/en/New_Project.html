  <td><p>This screen allows you to create a new project, set its name and filename and nominate where the database files are to be stored.</p>
<p>Note that this is <u>NOT</u> to be used to Import a TMG data set. The process for <a href="TMG_Import.html" title="Importing a TMG data set">Importing data from TMG</a> is separately selected from the TOOLS Menu.</p>

<img src="images/project_create.gif" alt="Create a new Project" style="width:300px;height:254px;margin:0.5em;" align="right" border="1" />
<p>Selecting Create Project from the Project Menu provides a three step process to follow:<br>
<p>1. Give your Project a name to identify it in future. This should be descriptive and may consist of several words, but must be unique</p>
<p>2. Click on BROWSE to choose where the database is to be stored. A default location will be presented but you may choose another if required</p>
<p>3. Once the file location has been selected, give your Project a concise <b>file name</b>, which must be different to any other HRE Project file stored in that location. Windows/MAC conventions as to characters you can use in filenames must be followed and HRE will automatically add the .mv.db file suffix. Press <b>SELECT</b>.</p>
<p>Now the Window will be complete showing your new Project Name, Filename and Location</p>
<p>At this point you can opt to <b>CANCEL</b> or <b>CREATE</b> the new Project.</p>
<p>If you have now created the project it will then be initialised, opened and made ACTIVE.  A window will appear to signify that process has been completed.</p>
You may now begin entering data into the new Project, or opt to change to another open project to be Active, or Open another project.<br>
