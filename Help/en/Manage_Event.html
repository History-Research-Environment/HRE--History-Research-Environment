<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>The Manage Event screen may be invoked in two ways, for different purposes.</p>
  
<p><b>1)</b> When invoked from the main menu it allows for the creation of new Events, Editing, Deleting or Copying an Event, or marking it as Disabled.<br>
An Event that is in use in your project may not be deleted.</p>

<p><b>2)</b> When invoked from a Person's screen by use of '<b>Add Event</b>' it allows you to select events for use.<br> 
This requires selection of the required Event and Role. The other functions described above may also be performed at this time.</p>

<p>By default the screen shows a list of All Events. Selecting an Event Group (like Birth, Marriage, etc) restricts the displayed events to just those events belonging to the selected group.</p>

<p>Selecting '<b>Your Event Groups</b>' changes the display to a different list which starts with the groups Census, Travel, Military and includes 4 groups 
whose names are undefined but which may be used as you wish.</p>

<p>Selecting '<b>Standard Groups</b>' returns you to the first group list.</p>

<p>The "<b>Other Events</b>' selection shows all events not assigned to a particular group.</p>

<p>Events can be quickly found by typing into the '<b>Find</b>' text-box when 'All Events' are displayed.</p>
