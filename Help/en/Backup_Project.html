<H1>Backup an HRE Project</H1>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>This screen allows you to backup an existing HRE Project, whether the Project is currently open in HRE or not. You can select the destination for the backup file, and choose whether or not to also backup External folders that are a part of the project. The default Backup location may be set in Tools > Settings > User > File Locations.</p>
<img src="images/project_backup.gif" alt="Backup an HRE Project" style="width:300px;height:239px;margin:0.5em;" align="right" border="1" />
<p>1. Select PROJECT >> BACKUP PROJECT and highlight the desired Project from the list presented</p>
<p>2. HRE will now display the Filename that will be applied to the backup, which is the Project name with the current time and date added. At this point there is an option to view a <b>SUMMARY</b> of the selected Project</p>
<p>3. Click on <b>BROWSE</b> to locate the folder where the backup is to be stored. Although the default folder will appear (as defined in the HRE Settings for File Locations), you may browse to select any other location. The file will be given the compacted backup file suffix of .hrez automatically. Once the desired location folder is in the window, press ENTER to select it</p>
<p>4. You can now opt to also backup External File Folders (images, documents, sound files, videos etc) that are associated with this project by ticking the selection box. This will open a new window which allows you to select one or more folders to backup and to specify where you want to save them, which may be different from the project backup location. The backup filename will contain the original folder's name and will be a standard zip filetype.</p>
<p>5. Now click <b>BACKUP</b> to start the process. If the nominated project is currently Open in HRE it will first be closed and then the backup will commence. The project database will be backed up first, followed by External File Folders (if you specified any).</p>
<p>6. Alternatively, select <b>CANCEL</b> if the backup is no longer required.</p>
