<table border="0" width="100%">

  <td><p>This option allows you to Close a project that is currently open in HRE.</p>
<img src="images/project_close.gif" alt="Close an Open HRE Project" style="width:300px;height:209px;margin:0.5em;" align="right" border="1" />
  <p>1. To close any presently open Project, select <b>PROJECT</b> from the menu, and then select the <b>CLOSE PROJECT</b> option</p>
<p>2. The list of Open Projects appears, showing Project Name, Filename and whether it is a local project or one on a server</p>
<p>3. Highlight the name of the Project you wish to close. In the illustration the 'My Workshop' Project has been selected from the currently Open projects. If there is only one open project it is selected by default</p>
<p>4. Once you highlight the required Project, the name appears below, to enable checking</p>
<p>5. Note that at this point, the selected Project can also be subjected to other processes, including <b>SUMMARY</b>, <b>VALIDATE</b> or <b>BACKUP</b>, and there is an option to <b>CANCEL</b> the closure</p>
<p>6. If you then select <b>CLOSE PROJECT</b> and confirm the decision, the Project will be closed (there will be no confirmation notice if that option was selected in Settings). HRE remains open so another Project can be opened if desired</p>
<p>7. If the Closed Project was currently the Active Project then you can opt to make another Project Active.</p>
