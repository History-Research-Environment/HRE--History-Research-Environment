<H1>Manage (Edit) a Person</font></H1>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>The Manage Person screen allows you to view and modify all existing data related to a person.<br>
The top section of the screen shows the identity of the person, Reference data and Birth-Sex, Partner and Children counts.</p>

Below that is the Parents table - this shows data for ALL related parents of any type (biological, adopted, foster, etc).<br>
<u>Right-clicking</u> within the Parents table allows you to choose to delete, add or edit these entries.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">Edit Categories</font></h2>

<p>The left panel of the screen allows you to choose to display data from 8 different categories, starting with Events, which are displayed by default when this screen opens.<br>
Each of these categories is explained in the following:</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Events</b></font><br>
* This table lists all recordeed events in order of their Sort Date<br>
* Witnessed events and Child events are shaded and can be removed or included in the event list by use of the check-boxes at the top of the list<br>
* Right-clicking in the table of events shows a list of possible actions, namely editing or deleting the selected event or adding a new event<br>
* A right-click in a Name-type event automatically opens an edit screen for that Name event.</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Partners</b></font><br>
* This table displays a list of all partners of this person<br>
* Care must be taken in the definition and creation of a person's partners and their related events, as HRE allows you to add a Partner without creation of an event linking the two people<br>
* You may add a partner from a right-click in the Partner table, then selecting 'Add new Partner'<br>
* After selecting someone from the offered list you can complete the process by defining the Event-type, Roles, optionally a Memo and then selecting whether you wish to add this Partner with, or without, also defining a Partner Event<br>
* Note: If a partner is created without a connecting event, they do not apear in either person's Associate table, as there is no 'association' between them.</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Associates</b></font><br>
* This table displays a list of all Associates of this person<br>
* Each entry shows the Associate, the event and date, and that person's Role in that event<br>
* A filter may be applied to filter for any text in any or all columns of the table.</p>
 
<p><font color="#008000"><b>All Names</b></font><br>
* This table displays a list of all the person's names, with the Primary name followed by the word 'Primary' in brackets<br>
* Right-clicking in the table sdisplays an Add/Delete/Edit menu; double-click of an entry opens the edit screen for that name.</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Flags</b></font><br>
* This table displays a list of all defined Flags and their settings for this person<br>
* Any of the current settings may be changed by clicking on the 'Setting' of a Flag.</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Media</b></font><br>
* This displays all media (images, text, audio or video) attached to this person, with captions.</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Notepads and DNA</b></font><br>
* These categories have not yet been implemented.</p>
