  <td><p>From <b>HELP</b> >> <b>Help Contents</b>, you can carry out several tasks in the <b>Help Navigator</b>, including browsing or searching Help topics, and printing out a copy of any chosen topic.</p>
<img src="images/help_navigator.gif" alt="The Help Navigator Window" style="width:300px;height:276px;margin:0.5em;" align="right" border="1" />
<p>1. The Help Contents screen displays the Help system's Table of Contents and from it you can choose topics to view, view the topic Index or Search for certain items</p>
<p>2. Each entry with a book symbol indicates there is an expanded list of items which can be revealed by double-clicking the book, or clicking once on the plus + sign.<br>
Double-click the open book or single click the minus - box to close the topic</p>
<p>3. Double-clicking on individual items opens the 'topic window' for that particular item.</p>

<p><b>The MAIN MENU AND TOPIC LIST</b></p>
<p>1. The FILE menu provides options to:<br>
- DISPLAY an open topic (also viewed by double-clicking the topic)<br>
- DISPLAY another topic in a new window (more than one topic Open, with windows stacked)<br>
- PRINT the Help tree structure<br>
- PRINT the topics (a large booklet!)<br>
- CLOSE the main window so as to just view an open topic file<br>
- EXIT from the HELP Contents completely, including open topic windows</p>
<p>2. The VIEW menu provides the option to view the tabs: Contens, Index or Search</p>
<p>3. The HELP menu shows current version details of the Help software.</p>

<p><b>CONTENTS TAB</b></p>
<p><b>Topic Screens</b></p>
<p>1. On each topic screen, you can read through the Help file</p>
<p>2. The FILE menu allows you to Print the topic, Close that topic window or Exit from the Help files</p>
<p>3. The GO menu allows you to go back or forward through topics you have browsed in this session, and this can also be accomplished via the hot keys (ALT-left or ALT-right) or by using the arrow icons</p>
<p>4. The TOOLS menu allows you to go back to the Help Navigator window (if you had earlier closed it) to search other topics, Copy highlighted text (CTRL-C), Highlight all text (CTRL-A), Find words or phrases in that topic and increase or decrease the topic font size</p>
<p>5. There are also icons to reopen the Help Navigator, to go back or forward through Help topics viewed in this session and to Print this topic.</p>

<p><b>INDEX TAB</b></p>
<p>1. This works like a pick list, opening topics or words in the whole Help system as you type letters into the index bar. As a word is exposed you can double-click on it to view the word in a Help topic.</p>

<p><b>SEARCH TAB</b></p>
<p>1. Working in a more defined way than the Index operation, the Search option allows for case sensitivity and Boolean searches, and you can click on the results to open the relevant Topic window.</p>
