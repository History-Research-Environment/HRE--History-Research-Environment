<H1>Restore a backed up HRE Project</H1>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>This screen allows you to restore previous backups and then work with that file as the current Open Project.<br>
The original Project, if still present, will only be overwritten if you specifically allow this to happen.</p>
<img src="images/project_restore.gif" alt="Restore a Project backup" style="width:350px;height:390px;margin:0.5em;" align="right" border="1" />

<p>1. Click on FIND A BACKUP FILE and from the File Chooser select the file you wish to restore; alternatively, browse to any other location and SELECT the file</p>
<p>2. Your selection, including its descriptive name, will be transferred back to the Project Restore window. Check the NOTES as to the options from here</p>
<p>3. Set the folder location where the Backup is to be restored to, again from the File Chooser window</p>
<p>4. The file name defaults to that used by the original Project, but MUST be changed if the same destination is to be used so as not to overwrite the original file</p>
<p>5. It is essential that the restored project be given a new descriptive name to differentiate it from the original project. Once this has been entered, click RESTORE</p>
<p>6. When completed, the restored project will be the Active Project</p>
<p>7. On checking, if the restored project is what was required, you can later opt to delete the old version of the project if it is still on this computer.</p> 
<p>8. The second part of the screen allows the restore of External Files (images, documents etc) from their backup zip files created in Project Backup. Note that the two parts of the screen work independently - in other words, you may restore an External File without restoring a Project file first.</p>
