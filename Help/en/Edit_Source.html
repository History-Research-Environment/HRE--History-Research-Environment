<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>The screen for Adding/Edit Sources allows you to create or edit all Source data</p>
  
<p>The screen consists of 3 tabs, for General Source data, Additional information and this Source's Connections to sources and Repositories.</p>

<p><b>General tab</b>:<br>
This defines the source Title <b><u>and</u></b> abbreviated Title (both must be present) and the Source Type they are derived from.<br>
Based on the selected Source type it also shows the Footnote and Bibliography templates that apply, plus all the relevant Source Elements belonging to those templates, with their assigned values (if any).<br>
If a template has been edited to be applicable to only this Source (a 'local template') then it is identified as having overridden the global (Source Type) template.<br>
The '<b>Preview</b>' buttons allow you to see the result of substituting the current Source Element values into each of the templates.</p>

<p><b>Additional tab:</b><br>
Under this tab the Source Fideility and its Active/Inactive state may be defined.<br>
Other data that may be recorded includes the Source Reference and Reminder data.<br>
If any person defined in the project is also an Author, Editor or Compiler of this Source data, they may also be recorded here.</p>

<p><b>Connections tab:</b><br>
Allows for the addition (or deletion) of any Source of this Source and the linkage to a Repository for this Source.</p>
