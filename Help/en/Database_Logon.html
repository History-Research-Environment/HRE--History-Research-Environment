<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>This dialog appears when you attempt to open an HRE project defined on a remote server.</p>

The screen displays 3 data entry areas, as follows:<br>
1. Remote connection data, consisting of the Database type; server IP address; server port number. This information is mainly for confirmation purposes and you would normally not be expected to change it<p></p>

<p>2. Your logon ID for this project, as provided by the System Administrator of the remote server and saved by HRE</p>

<p>3. Your password for this project, as initially provided by the System Administrator of the remote server</p>

NOTE:<br> 
<p>* HRE will only allow 3 logon attempts before failing the logon process.
</p>
<p>* Use of a remote server requires HRE to be in 'server mode' - this is set in <b>Tools->Settings->Server Mode</b>.</p>
