<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>The Define Event screen allows you to add new Event types to your project.<br>
Selection of the Language (which defaults to the current HRE Data language) allows for the event to be defined for any supported language.</p>

<p>The screen consists of 3 tabs for General settings, Roles and Sentences, plus Event Hints.</p>

<p><b>General settings:</b><br>
Here you can define the new Event's name and which event group it belongs to.<br>
The GEDCOM settings define how it should be exported to GEDCOM - either under its own tag name or as an Event tag with a sub-type.<br>
The Event validity settings define in what calendar year range the event may be used and the Minimum number of Primary Associates are required for this event.</p>

<p><b>Roles and Sentences:</b><br>
This section allows for the definition of the roles that can be applied to associates of the event and whether or not they are Primary (required) roles.<br>
Sentence structures may be defined for each role and each role can be restricted by Sex and age.</p>

<p><b>Event Hints:</b><br>
This tab provides you with a free-form text area for you to describe any hints that you may wish to record to assist in the usage of the event.<br>
This is in addition to the 'Reminder' function that applies to the overall usage of this screen.</p>
