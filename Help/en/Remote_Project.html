The Remote Project Definition dialog allows you to Define an HRE Project which exists on a remote server, or Edit such a definition, based on your selection of one of these two functions in the initial display. 
<br><br>
Selection of 'Edit a Remote Project' allows you to choose a remote project from the list of all such projects currently known to your HRE installation.
<br>
Once a remote project is selected, the screen expands to show 2 sections of Project information for editing.
<br>  
Choosing 'Define a New Remote Project' displays the same 2 sections of Project information, in this case for initial entry.
<br><br>
The first set of information is the definition of the Remote Project - its Name, Filename and Location on the remote server.
<br>
The second set of information defines the Remote Server - its Name, IP address and Port number for access.
<br><br>
All this information will be provided to you by the Administrator of the remote server, who will have created the HRE Project you wish to access.<br><br>
When the information is complete you may save it. Access to the defined remote HRE Project will then be possible by use of the normal HRE 'Open Project' screen.
