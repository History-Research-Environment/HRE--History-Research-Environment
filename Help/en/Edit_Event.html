<table border="0" width="100%">

  <td>
<p>The Edit Event screen allows you to edit the selected Event of your project.<br>
The Language defaults to the current HRE Data language but may be changed to edit the Event for any other supported language.</p>

<p>The screen consists of 3 tabs for General settings, Roles and Sentences, plus Event Hints.</p>

<p><b>General settings:</b><br>
Here you can edit the Event's name and which event group it belongs to.<br>
The GEDCOM settings define how it should be exported to GEDCOM - either under its own tag name or as an Event tag with a sub-type equal to the name.<br>
The Event validity settings define in what calendar year range the event may be used and the Minimum number of Primary Associates are required for this event.</p>

<p><b>Roles and Sentences:</b><br>
This section allows for the editing of the roles that can be applied to associates of the event and whether or not they are Primary (required) roles.<br>
Sentence structures may be edited for each role and each role can be restricted by Sex and Age.<br>
Note that changing the Event language will change the roles to those that are applicable for that language.</p>

<p><b>Event Hints:</b><br>
This tab provides you with a free-form text area for you to describe any hints that you may wish to record to assist in the usage of the event.</p>
