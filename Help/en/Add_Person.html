<H1>Adding a Person To HRE</font></H1>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>The Add Person screen allows you to add a new (unrelated) person or add relations, such as parents, siblings and children.<br>
If there is no active Person screen, the Person menu will only allow addition of an unrelated person.</p>

<p>Each of the radio buttons on the left of the screen can be used to change the display on the right to allow entry of information defining the person's Name, Flag status and up to 4 Events for that person.<br>
The Person's Name Style and the Location Style for the events can be individually set by use of the Style drop-down selections.<br>
The BIRTH-SEX flag will be prompted for if not initially set.<br>
The LIVING flag will be set to 'No' if a Death event is defined.</p>
 
<p>For each of the Event screens (Birth, Baptism/Christening, Death, Burial) any event in that event group may be chosen, along with a Role in that event.<br>
Setting of dates and locations is optional, as this data can be edited later if necessary.<br>
Setting of Memos and Citation data is also optional across all sub-screens.<br>
When you have entered all relevant data, use of the '<b>SAVE</b>' button will save ALL entered data. Events where you have not entered data will not be created. </p>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">Partners and Partner Events</font></h2>

<p>Care must be taken in the definition and creation of a person's partners and their related events, as follows:<br>
<ul>
    <li>If you choose to add a Partner to an existing person, a fifth event option (Partner Event) appears in the left-panel and additional data to define the partner event and roles appears in the Name panel<br></li>
    <li>If the Partner Event panel is not used, you will be prompted to consider entering data to define the event's date and location - this is optional, as HRE allows you to add a Partner without creating an event linking the two people<br></li>
    <li>If a partner is created without a connecting event, they do not, of course, appear in either person's Associate table, as there is no 'association' between them.</li>
</ul></p>
