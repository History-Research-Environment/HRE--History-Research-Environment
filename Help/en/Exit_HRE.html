<H1>EXIT from HRE</H1>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>This option allows you to close Open Project(s) and exit from the HRE program, with an option to carry out other processes before the close.</p>
<p>There are two ways to Exit HRE, and there are slight variations, but the end result is the same.</p>
<b>A] FROM THE PROJECT MENU</b><br>
<img src="images/project_close.gif" alt="Project Close" style="width:300px;height:163px;margin:0.5em;" align="right" border="1" />
<p>1. Select Close Project from the main Project menu</p>
<p>2. Click on the Project you want to close, so it is highlighted
<p>3. You now have five options<br>
- To view a <b>Summary</b> of the selected Project<br>
- To <b>Validate</b> the Project, ensuring indexes and other parts are correct and complete, and auto-correcting any errors if possible<br>
- To <b>Backup</b> the Project before you close it, giving you an option to record your backup in a chosen location<br>
- To <b>Cancel</b> the closure<br>
- To actually <b>Close the Project.</b></p>
<p>4. As each project is closed, a message will advise this has happened, unless Cancel prompts have been turned off in the HRE Settings</p>
<p>5. HRE closes when all open Projects have been closed</p>
<p>6. Note that the last project closed will be the project that is automatically opened at the next use of HRE if the HRE Setting to 'Open last closed project' has been turned on.</p>

<br><b>B] FROM THE X AT TOP RIGHT OF THE HRE MAIN SCREEN</b>
<p>1. You will be asked to confirm that you want to exit HRE, unless Cancel prompts have been turned off in the HRE Settings</p>
<p>2. If there is only one project open, it will be closed</p>
<p>3. If more than one project is open, the Close Project screen described above will open</p>
<p>4. As each project is closed, a message will advise this has happened, unless Cancel prompts have been turned off in the HRE Settings</p>
<p>5. HRE closes when all open Projects have been closed</p>
<p>6. Note that the last project closed will be the project that is automatically opened at the next use of HRE if the HRE Setting to 'Open last closed project' has been turned on.</p>
