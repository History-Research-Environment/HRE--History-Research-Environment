  <tr>
  <td><p>This screen allows a project administrator to define the users who may have access to an HRE project.<br>
By default, the original creator of an HRE project has full administration rights to the project and can then use this function to add other users.</p>

<p>The screen displays a table of projects currently known to this HRE implementation, followed by a table of the known users, which is populated when a project is selected in the project table.<br>
A project may also be searched for by use of the '<b>Browse...</b>' button.</p>

<p>Controls are provided for Adding and Deleting users and changing the password of a user.<br>
Passwords must be at least 8 characters, including a capital letter, lower case letter, number and a special character.</p>
