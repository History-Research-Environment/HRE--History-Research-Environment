<H1>SELECT LOCATION</H1>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<p>
The Location Selector displays a table of all locations defined in the project, preceded by various controls to allow for tailoring of the contents of the display.</p>

<p><b>Location picklist display options:</b><br>
The first two lines of controls above the list of locations allow finding particular locations or filtering the display to a subset of the entries.<br>
Entering data in the "Find anywhere" box and pressing Enter will select the first location with a field containing text which matches the entered text (the matching process is case-neutral). "Find Next" will move on to the next match.</p> 

<p>To filter the list, enter the required text in the "Text to filter for:" field, select the "Filter" checkbox and select the table column to use to apply the filter (or choose All Columns). Removing the "Filter" check will return the display to the full list.</p>

<p>The order of the <b>Table of Locations</b> can be altered in a number of ways. Clicking on any of the table header's fields will sort the table on that field's numeric or alphabetic order (or reverse order if clicked again). This is indicated by a small arrow at the right of the table header's fieldname.<br>
By default, the table displays a summary of the location's fields in the first column, followed by a number of columns of location data. The names of these fields, and their order, matches the current default Location Name Style. Any of the information may be excluded from the display by use of the Configuration tool (the Spanner icon) in the screen's icons at top right.</p>

<p>Entries in the "<b>Location</b>" column may be preceded by "<b>*</b>" which indicates that media is present for this location entry.</p>

<p><b>Displaying other screens:</b><br>
A double-click on any location in the list will create and display the Viewpoint screen for that Location.<br>
A right-click on any Location in the list will display a popup menu which allows selection of display of that Location's Viewpoint OR display of the 'Manage Location' screen.</p>
