<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td><p>This screen allows the user to examine the HRE activity log files that are created each time HRE is opened, and to opt to carry out several tasks on those files.</p>
<img src="images/logging.gif" alt="Logging Report" style="width:300px;height:239px;margin:0.5em;" align="right" border="1" />
<p>1. Select REPORTS >> LOGGING</p>
<p>2. Click on BROWSE to open the default folder for HRE log files, as shown</p>
<p>3. A list of the daily log files are now in view, and double-clicking any of these will open the file, which shows all the activity in HRE during that particular day</p>
<p>4. The log file may contain a great amount of data under the headings: Date, Time, Server (Computer), Project Name and Log Entry. Note the latter column may include program actions as well as errors</p>
<p>5. You can now output the log contents, or a selected part of it, to a file or printer. This may be valuable for technical support or retracing steps made in an HRE session. To <b>Output All</b> or a <b>Selection</b> use the mouse to highlight your chosen lines of the log. The destination can be a file or a printer, including a PDF file. Once that has been done, clicking on <b>Reset Selection</b> restores the whole log file to view once more, or allows choice of another log file.</p>
<p>6. Close the Logging window when completed.</p>
